# PETSOFT
PetSoft is a database-driven pet management system designed to streamline and digitalize operations in animal care services. Developed using PHP and MySQL, this platform allows multiple user roles—Admin, Doctor, Employee, and Customer—to interact with the system through dedicated interfaces.

The system supports pet registration, appointment booking, medical record tracking, employee and doctor management, and animal shelter operations. By leveraging relational database concepts, PetSoft ensures secure, efficient, and organized data handling across modules.

This project demonstrates the practical application of DBMS principles in real-world scenarios and serves as a learning model for building full-stack CRUD-based applications with role-based access control.
